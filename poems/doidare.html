        And indeed there will be time
        To wonder, “Do I dare?” and, “Do I dare?”
        Time to <a href="../insecure_home.html" class="reg_href">turn back</a> and descend the stair,
        With a bald spot in the middle of my hair —
        (They will say: “How his hair is growing thin!”)
        My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,
        My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin —
        (They will say: “But how his arms and legs are thin!”)

        <a href="../insecurity/insecurity1.html" class="reg_href">Disturb the universe?</a>

        For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.
